### Interactive Projects

Some projects you can play with in the browser *right now*:
- [AntLogic](https://ant-logic.thebenjicat.dev/) - AntLogic is a complex logic gate puzzle game built to enhance understanding of boolean logic. Puzzles range from simple lessons on Demorgan's law to challenges testing true understanding of boolean functions. Built at IrvineHacks 2024.
- [Ball Blitz](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/ball_blitz) - the circle matching Suika Game, but in 3d
- [Interactive EM](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/Interactive-EM) - Developed at Friday Night Lab with peers, Interactive EM solves complex equipotential diagrams and electric field vectors using a complete 2-dimensional simulation.
- [Matrix Assistant](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/matrix_assistant) - Inspired by my frustrations with minor arithmetic mistakes in linear algebra, I developed Matrix Assistant to guide the row reduction process with error correction.
- [XprtCalc](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/XprtCalc) - An advanced calculator that emulates lambda calculus.
- [ResumeExpress](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/resume_express) - Quick, dyanamic resume editor with export to JSON and LaTeX.
- [Summer Camp Browser](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/summer_camp_browser) - Built to help my students discover and apply to high school summer camps, Summer Camp Browser shows all the requirements and descriptions in a unified interface.

### Other projects

- [MipsWeaver.rs](https://github.com/benjamin-cates/MipsWeaver.rs) (beta) - Complete simulation tool for the MIPS assembly language and instruction set architecture.
- [PyHa Analyzer](https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/acoustic-multiclass-training) - A PyTorch-powered bird call classification system from the [University of California San Diego Engineers For Exploration](https://github.com/UCSD-E4E) research cohort.
In summer 2023, I worked at an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates to accelerate development of PyHa Analyzer. After 2 months of full-time research, our team of four presented our advancements to the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and the public.
- [Topographic Sand Map](https://github.com/fnlHub/topographic-sand-map) - After the previous team abandonded this project, I single-handedly developed the Topographic Sand Map at College of the Sequoias' Friday Night Lab to create a real-time interactive demonstration of topography lines. Using the Microsoft Kinect device, depth of each element on the table is calculated 30 times per second and processed through C# code and shaders to create a real time map.
- [Advent of Code 2023 and 2024](https://github.com/benjamin-cates/aoc) - Solved all 25 daily mathematical challenges of both <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023">Advent of Code 2023</a> and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024">2024</a> with efficient algorithms written in the Rust programming language.
