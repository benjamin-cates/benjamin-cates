- [Cat Factory](https://catfactory.thebenjicat.dev) - Push boxes and buttons to get to safety.
- [AntLogic](https://ant-logic.thebenjicat.dev/) - Solve cute logic gate puzzles to learn simple and complex boolean logic. Built at IrvineHacks 2024.
- [Ball Blitz](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/ball_blitz) - Spawn sports spheres and merge in a 3D suika-like game.
- [Interactive EM](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/Interactive-EM) - Simulate complex electric fields with a 2D interactive tool. Built at Friday Night Lab with peers.
- [Matrix Assistant](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/matrix_assistant) - Row reduce smoothly with an error-correcting training program.
- [XprtCalc](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/XprtCalc) - Compute lambda calculus with a fully-featured calculator.

### Other projects

- [MipsWeaver.rs](https://github.com/benjamin-cates/MipsWeaver.rs) (beta) - Complete simulation tool for the MIPS assembly language and instruction set architecture.
- [PyHa Analyzer](https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/acoustic-multiclass-training) - A PyTorch-powered bird call classification system from the [University of California San Diego Engineers For Exploration](https://github.com/UCSD-E4E) research cohort. In summer 2023, I worked at an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates to accelerate development of PyHa Analyzer. After 2 months of full-time research, our team of four presented our advancements to the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and the public.
- [Topographic Sand Map](https://github.com/fnlHub/topographic-sand-map) - After the previous team abandonded this project, I single-handedly developed the Topographic Sand Map at College of the Sequoias' Friday Night Lab to create a real-time interactive demonstration of topography lines. Using the Microsoft Kinect device, depth of each element on the table is calculated 30 times per second and processed through C# code and shaders to create a real time map.
- [Summer Camp Browser](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/summer_camp_browser) - Built to help my students discover and apply to high school summer camps, Summer Camp Browser shows all the requirements and descriptions in a unified interface.
- [Advent of Code 2023 and 2024](https://github.com/benjamin-cates/aoc) - Solved all 25 daily mathematical challenges of both <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023">Advent of Code 2023</a> and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024">2024</a> with efficient algorithms written in the Rust programming language.
