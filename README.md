### Projects

Most of my experience is in TypeScript, Python, and C++

Special thanks to [Friday Night Lab](https://fnlhub.com) for giving me the space to do some of these.

Some projects you can play with in the browser *right now*:
- [Interactive EM](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/Interactive-EM) - an educational interactive simulation of the electric field around charges
- [Matrix Assistant](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/matrix_assistant) - a tool that guides you through matrix row reduction without making mistakes
- [XprtCalc](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/XprtCalc) - an advanced calculator that emulates some features of programming languages
